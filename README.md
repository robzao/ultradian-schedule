# Ultradian Schedule

A **time management** model based on human chronobiology and the ultradian rhythm for high performance. The day is divided into **13 ultradian blocks** of approximately **110 minutes**. The morning routine begins at 6:00 AM, ensuring circadian alignment with the Petrópolis / Brazil morning photopic signal (UTC-03:00). Each work block uses a cognitive **fatigue indicator**:

- **Green**: full and sustainable focus;
- **Yellow**: near exhaustion of attention;
- **Red**: interruption of the task and immediate shift to diffuse mode.

**Task allocation** respects the daily performance curve, reserving morning alertness peaks for activities with high cognitive demand:

- **06:00:00–07:50:46**: Morning Routine (1 block);
- **07:50:46–13:23:05**: Learning Routine (3 blocks);
- **13:23:05–15:13:51**: Social Routine (1 block);
- **15:13:51–17:04:37**: Fitness Routine (1 block);
- **17:04:37–18:55:23**: Active Recall Routine (1 block);
- **18:55:23–20:46:09**: Evening Routine (1 block);
- **20:46:09–06:00:00**: Deep Rest (5 blocks).
